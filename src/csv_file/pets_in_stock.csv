Make sure that the fixture isnt being moved regularly. It is best to use a quality ceramic socket, not a plastic socket. You can check your fixture by unplugging it and looking at the metal tab in the center - where the bulb screws in.

CAUTION: Do not use with freshwater crustaceans, including shrimp, crabs and lobsters.</p><p>Warm Weather Caution: Before using PondCare Algaefix, make certain that the pond has vigorous aeration, i.e., a fountain, waterfall, or aeration device to avoid fish loss due to low oxygen levels. When algae is controlled and removed by the filter or settle to the bottom of the pond, the oxygen level may drop to harmful levels if adequate aeration is not provided. Therefore, when using PondCare Algaefix during warm weather and high water temperatures, vigorous, 24 hour aeration is required.

As ectotherms, or cold-blooded animals, reptiles depend on the surrounding environmental temperature to regulate their own body temperatures. If the temperature is not appropriate, your pet may be susceptible to digestive problems or infections. Flukers Infrared Deep Thermal Heat Lamp Bulbs feature an advanced carbon fiber filament that emits both Infrared A and Infrared B, providing deep muscle tissue penetration that mimics natural suns heat. The infrared medium wave energy is easily absorbed by the reptile, which gently increases the temperature of their skin. The advanced Infrared Deep Thermal Heat Bulb offers 24/7 heat with minimal visible light and zero UV emission, so it wont disturb the sleep of reptiles or pets. The heating speed is fast and stable, and the heat is balanced and lasting, making it the perfect heat lamp for any style of terrarium. The parabolic reflector focuses heatwaves for optimal basking conditions, making it the perfect solution to maintain the humidity in your enclosure and prevent dehydration, as they do not evaporate water as quickly as standard heating lamps. These bulbs are manufactured with precision, resulting in higher quality and long-lasting durability. The carbon fiber filament ensures constant heat emission, while the heavy-duty construction guarantees higher durability and longevity. To ensure proper use, refer to the convenient temperature guide on the packaging.

If a reptile is not provided with an appropriate environmental temperature range (ETR), it cannot regulate its core body temperature and may be more prone to chronic infections. Ideal ETR varies from species to species; consult your pet professional for lighting recommendations for your pet. Flukers Black Nightlight bulbs emit low levels of supplemental UV radiation to provide the heat reptiles need during the night cycle.</p><p>The sun produces three types of light: ultraviolet, visible, and infrared. UV light helps in regulating behavior and stimulating Vitamin D production in reptiles. Visible light is the spectrum of light that allows humans and animals to see within our environment. Flukers 5.0 UVB and 10.0 UVB Sun Glow Coil Bulbs generate both UV and visible light and should be used in combination with Flukers incandescent light bulbs to mimic natural sunlight.</p><p>Directions: Gently fasten the Flukers incandescent bulb into a Fluker Clamp Lamp or Hood, or any UL-approved incandescent fixture. Do not plug the light fixture into an electrical socket until the bulb is fastened firmly to the fixture. Place light fixture outside of reptiles enclosure.</p><p>Important: NEVER place the light fixture inside the enclosure. Reptiles can develop life-threatening thermal burns from contact with an exposed light bulb.</p><p>Note: Multiple incandescent lights may be required to establish an appropriate ETR. A Flukers thermometer can be used to monitor temperature within the reptiles environment. Reptile behavior is directly tied to photoperiod (light cycle), so it is important to provide appropriate intervals of flight and darkness. Flukers recommends a 12-hour day/12-hour night light cycle. A Flukers Daytime bulb should be used during the daytime cycle.</p>",Flukers,NEW,1,2.4,2.4,4.4,0.1,"ITEMIMAGEURL1=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22702__1.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL2=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22702__2.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL3=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22702__3.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL4=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22702__4.jpg",4,,flukers-black-nightlight-bulb-incandescent-reptile-light,https://www.petwholesaleusa.com/products/flukers-black-nightlight-bulb-incandescent-reptile-light

If a reptile is not provided with an appropriate environmental temperature range (ETR), it cannot regulate its core body temperature and may be more prone to chronic infections. Ideal ETR varies from species to species; consult your pet professional for lighting recommendations for your pet. Flukers Red Heat Incandescent Bulbs provide moderate heat combined with low light, perfect for observing nocturnal reptiles.</p><p>Directions: Gently fasten the Flukers incandescent bulb into a Fluker Clamp Lamp or Hood or any UL-approved incandescent fixture. Do not plug the light fixture into an electrical socket until the bulb is fastened firmly to the fixture. Place light fixture outside for reptiles enclosure. NEVER place the light fixture inside the enclosure. Reptiles can develop life-threatening thermal burns from contact with an exposed light bulb.</p><p>Note: Multiple incandescent lights may be required to establish an appropriate ETR. A Flukers thermometer can be used to monitor temperature within the reptiles environment. Reptile behavior is directly tied to photoperiod (light cycle), so it is important to provide appropriate intervals of light and darkness. Flukers recommends a 12-hour day/12-hour night light cycle. A Flukers Daytime bulb should be used during the daytime cycle.</p>",Flukers,NEW,1,2.5,2.5,5,0.1,"ITEMIMAGEURL1=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22804__1.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL2=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22804__2.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL3=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22804__3.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL4=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22804__4.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL5=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22804__5.jpg",5,,flukers-red-heat-bulb-incandescent-reptile-light,https://www.petwholesaleusa.com/products/flukers-red-heat-bulb-incandescent-reptile-light

For synthetically lined pond and fountain use only, where all water is contained without any outflow.</p><p>Add 1 teaspoonful for every 50 gallons of pond/fountain water or 1/2 cup for every 1,200 gallons. Thoroughly mix into pond/fountain by adding near the pump outflow, waterfall, or aeration device. Can be mixed in a bucket of pond/fountain water and dispersed evenly around the pond/fountain. Repeat application every 3 days until algae is controlled. Be prepared to siphon out dead filamentous algae. 8 ounces treats up to 2,400 gallons. 16 ounces treats up to 4,800 gallons. 32 ounces treats up to 9,800 gallons. 64 ounces treats up to 19,200 gallons. 1 gallon treats up to 38,400 gallons. 2.5 gallons treats up to 96,000 gallons.</p><p>Once algal growth is under control, add one dose per week.

CAUTION: Do not use with freshwater crustaceans, including shrimp, crabs and lobsters.</p><p>Warm Weather Caution: Before using PondCare Algaefix, make certain that the pond has vigorous aeration, i.e., a fountain, waterfall, or aeration device to avoid fish loss due to low oxygen levels. When algae is controlled and removed by the filter or settle to the bottom of the pond, the oxygen level may drop to harmful levels if adequate aeration is not provided. Therefore, when using PondCare Algaefix during warm weather and high water temperatures, vigorous, 24 hour aeration is required.

Do not plug the light fixture into an electrical socket until the bulb is fastened firmly to the fixture. Place light fixture outside for reptiles enclosure. NEVER place the light fixture inside the enclosure. Reptiles can develop life-threatening thermal burns from contact with an exposed light bulb.</p><p>Note: Multiple incandescent lights may be required to establish an appropriate ETR. A Flukers thermometer can be used to monitor temperature within the reptiles environment. Reptile behavior is directly tied to photoperiod (light cycle), so it is important to provide appropriate intervals of light and darkness. Flukers recommends a 12-hour day/12-hour night light cycle. A Flukers Daytime bulb should be used during the daytime cycle.</p>",Flukers,NEW,1,2.4,2.4,4.4,0.1,"ITEMIMAGEURL1=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22801__1.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL2=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22801__2.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL3=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22801__3.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL4=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/fk22801__4.jpg",4,,flukers-red-heat-bulb-incandescent-reptile-light,https://www.petwholesaleusa.com/products/flukers-red-heat-bulb-incandescent-reptile-light

CAUTION: Do not use with freshwater crustaceans, including shrimp, crabs and lobsters.</p><p>Warm Weather Caution: Before using PondCare Algaefix, make certain that the pond has vigorous aeration, i.e., a fountain, waterfall, or aeration device to avoid fish loss due to low oxygen levels.

Therefore, when using PondCare Algaefix during warm weather and high water temperatures, vigorous, 24 hour aeration is required.

If a reptile is not provided with an appropriate environmental temperature range (ETR), it cannot regulate its core body temperature and may be more prone to chronic infections. Ideal ETR varies from species to species; consult your pet professional for lighting recommendations for your pet. Flukers Black Nightlight bulbs emit low levels of supplemental UV radiation to provide the heat reptiles need during the night cycle.</p><p>The sun produces three types of light: ultraviolet, visible, and infrared. UV light helps in regulating behavior and stimulating Vitamin D production in reptiles. Visible light is the spectrum of light that allows humans and animals to see within our environment. Flukers 5.0 UVB and 10.0 UVB Sun Glow Coil Bulbs generate both UV and visible light and should be used in combination with Flukers incandescent light bulbs to mimic natural sunlight.</p><p>Directions: Gently fasten the Flukers incandescent bulb into a Fluker Clamp Lamp or Hood, or any UL-approved incandescent fixture. Do not plug the light fixture into an electrical socket until the bulb is fastened firmly to the fixture. Place light fixture outside of reptiles enclosure.</p><p>Important: NEVER place the light fixture inside the enclosure. Reptiles can develop life-threatening thermal burns from contact with an exposed light bulb.</p><p>Note: Multiple incandescent lights may be required to establish an appropriate ETR. A Flukers thermometer can be used to monitor temperature within the reptiles environment. Reptile behavior is directly tied to photoperiod (light cycle), so it is important to provide appropriate intervals of flight and darkness. Flukers recommends a 12-hour day/12-hour night light cycle.

Whereas barley straw works by releasing certain natural chemicals as it biodegrades, so do the pellets in MICROBE-LIFT/Barley Straw Pellets +, only the breakdown compounds are released faster: dispersing equally throughout the water; reacting photochemically with sunlight; and activating humic acids to produce hydrogen peroxide-an oxidizing agent that also helps to keep the water clear-naturally and at a low level of release. The humic acid will also chelate metals such as copper or arsenic. MICROBE-LIFT/Barley Straw Pellets + are rich in organic peat which softens pond water-reducing nitrate and phosphate concentrations in the water column-and provides a buffering agent and ion attenuation in lined ponds that additionally gives them some beneficial properties of earthen ponds!.</p><p>Please note: MICROBE-LIFT/Barley Straw Pellets + will leave a residual on the bottom of the pond.

Purigens impact on trace elements is minimal. It significantly raises redox. It polishes water to unparalleled clarity. Purigen darkens progressively as it exhausts, and is easily renewed by treating with bleach. Purigen is designed for both marine and freshwater use.</p><p>Why Its Different:.</p><ul><li>Selectivity: Purigen is the highest capacity organic filtration resin on the market. No other products can compare to its ability to clear haziness and polish water to unparalleled clarity. Unlike other products on the market which are simple ion-exchange resins, Purigen is specifically designed to be an organic scavenging resin. When ion-exchange resins are filled to capacity by metals and other contaminants, Purigen has barely begun to reach its potential. Purigen generally ignores simple elemental compounds, having an extreme affinity for nitrogenous organics. The primary source of nitrogenous compounds in an aquarium is waste. Fish, corals, even plants produce nitrogenous waste. Purigen removes that waste faster and more completely than anything else on the market.</li><li>Capacity: Purigens possesses enhanced capacity owing to its vast surface area. All other resins on the market are purely spherical extruded beads. These beads remain smooth even under a microscope. Purigen is both spherical and macroreticular. It has microscopic pores that increase its usable surface area to many times that of a purely spherical resin.</li><li>Regeneration: Purigen can also be regenerated. As it adsorbs waste products, Purigen will change color from a pale blonde to a dark brown, almost black. Once it is exhausted, it can be regenerated with a solution of bleach and water. The bleach will literally &ldquo;burn off"" the organics that have been removed from the tank. Watch out for products that claim to be regenerable with a brine solution. That is the regeneration procedure for ion-exchange purposes. A brine solution will not remove organics. While such resins have a limited capacity for organic adsorption, a brine regeneration process only replaces removed ionic compounds. It does not destroy large organic molecules that were removed, which is the primary function of organic adsorption resins.</li></ul><p>Directions:<br>Rinse before use. Use in a fine mesh filter bag. Each 1 L treats up to 4,000 L (1,000 gallons) for up to six months. Exhaustion is indicated by a pronounced discoloration of the beads to dark brown or black.</p><p>Regeneration: Soak in a 1:1 bleach:water solution for 24 hours in a non-metalic container in a well ventilated area and away from children. Rinse well, then soak for 8 hours with a solution containing 2 tablespoons of ChlorGuard, Prime, or equivalent dechlorinator per cup of water. Rinse well. Original color and full activity should now be restored and Purigen is ready for reuse. Caution: some slime coat products may permanently foul Purigen and render regeneration difficult. Do not reuse if odor of chlorine is detectable. In case of doubt, soak beads in small quantity of water and test for residual chlorine with a chlorine test kit.</p><p>Dosage:<br>100 ml (Media Bag): Treats 106 Gallons<br>250 ml: Treats 265 Gallons<br>500 ml: Treats 530 Gallons<br>1 Liter: Treats 1,060 Gallons<br>2 Liters: Treats 2,120 Gallons.</p>",Seachem,NEW,1,2.44,2.44,4.81,0.7,"ITEMIMAGEURL1=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/sc01660__1.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL2=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/sc01660__2.jpg",2,,seachem-purigen-removes-organic-waste-from-marine-and-freshwater-aquariums,https://www.petwholesaleusa.com/products/seachem-purigen-removes-organic-waste-from-marine-and-freshwater-aquariums

Dissolve in at least one cup of freshwater. This dose will also raise alkalinity by about 1 meq/L. Add daily until pH stabilizes at 8.3. This will take from a day to a week, depending on original pH and alkalinity. Thereafter, use biweekly or monthly to maintain a pH of 8.3. If this practice is not adequate, then overstocking, overfeeding, or other poor management practice should be sought as a likely cause. In ionically balanced marine water, Marine Buffer produces little precipitate or cloudiness. If an extensive precipitate forms upon addition of Marine Buffer that does not dissolve within about 15 minutes, then poor ionic balance was present. A water change should be initiated when convenient before further use of the product. Effectiveness improves with continued use.

If a reptile is not provided with an appropriate environmental temperature range (ETR), it cannot regulate its core body temperature and may be more prone to chronic infections. Ideal ETR varies from species to species; consult your pet professional for lighting recommendations for your pet. Flukers Red Heat Incandescent Bulbs provide moderate heat combined with low light, perfect for observing nocturnal reptiles.</p><p>Directions: Gently fasten the Flukers incandescent bulb into a Fluker Clamp Lamp or Hood or any UL-approved incandescent fixture. Do not plug the light fixture into an electrical socket until the bulb is fastened firmly to the fixture. Place light fixture outside for reptiles enclosure. NEVER place the light fixture inside the enclosure. Reptiles can develop life-threatening thermal burns from contact with an exposed light bulb.</p><p>Note: Multiple incandescent lights may be required to establish an appropriate ETR. A Flukers thermometer can be used to monitor temperature within the reptiles environment. Reptile behavior is directly tied to photoperiod (light cycle), so it is important to provide appropriate intervals of light and darkness. Flukers recommends a 12-hour day/12-hour night light cycle.

Dissolve in at least one cup of freshwater. This dose will also raise alkalinity by about 1 meq/L. Add daily until pH stabilizes at 8.3. This will take from a day to a week, depending on original pH and alkalinity. Thereafter, use biweekly or monthly to maintain a pH of 8.3. If this practice is not adequate, then overstocking, overfeeding, or other poor management practice should be sought as a likely cause. In ionically balanced marine water, Marine Buffer produces little precipitate or cloudiness. If an extensive precipitate forms upon addition of Marine Buffer that does not dissolve within about 15 minutes, then poor ionic balance was present. A water change should be initiated when convenient before further use of the product. Effectiveness improves with continued use.

A damp cloth can also be used to remove stains from the cover.Cleaning the Memory FoamThe memory foam is not machine washable, but there are several ways to clean it. To freshen it up, lightly sprinkle baking powder on the foam. This will give the foam a fresh smell. Let it sit for 30 minutes. Then vacuum the baking powder with a vacuum cleaner, which can also remove pet hair from the memory foam. To remove a stain, use a damp cloth with warm water and a small amount of dishwashing soap to rub the stain in a light circular motion. Let it sit for 10 minutes and press out as much moisture as you can without ""wringing out"" the foam, because wet foam can tear more easily.

Because it uses only naturally occurring and/or beneficial bacteria and does not affect pH (acidity/alkalinity), it is safe for aquatic turtles, amphibians, and other aquatic life. These bacteria are 100% non-toxic, non-pathogenic, and feed only on decomposing organic matter. In other words, they are not a health hazard to humans, fish, pets, plants, or wildlife!.</p><p>Now the technical stuff: 4 ounces of Tidy Turtle contains more than 2 billion Colony Forming Units (CFU) of heterotrophic bacteria per milliliter, as well as the enzymes that help break down turtle waste products. These various species of bacteria consume carbohydrates, proteins, starches, fats and cellulose that build up in turtle habitats and turtle aquariums as the result of feeding, turtle waste, decaying plant matter and other organics. The Bacillus species in Tidy Turtle can function in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, allowing these organisms to function in the best and worst of turtle habitat or turtle aquarium conditions.</p><p>Made in the USA.</p><p>Directions: Shake well. Add 2 teaspoons (10ml) for every ten gallons of water (37.85L) directly into the water. Repeat dosage after 24 hours. Repeat the above steps bi-weekly or when wanting to remove visible sludge. To increase effectiveness, add directly into filter media, particularly activated carbon. Activated carbon is an excellent surface area for the Bacillus sp. bacteria in Tidy Turtle.

Calcium and carbonates are essential to all coral growth. If either becomes deficient, coral growth will cease, followed by a rapid decline in coral health. To prevent this you must provide calcium (Reef complete) and carbonates (Reef Builder or Reef Carbonate) Reef Complete also includes magnesium and strontium in amounts proportionate to typical utilization ratios (100:5:0.1, Ca:Mg: Sr). This allows one to maintain these two important elements while maintaining calcium. Reef Complete is a blended product. It is not simply calcium chloride. Commercially available calcium chloride contains ammonia. Unlike other ionic calcium supplements, Reef Complete is blended to a higher pH to force the ammonia to gas off into the atmosphere. Also, Reef Complete is more concentrated than any other liquid product on the market.

Aqueon Pure is the solution for aquarists who want to bring balance to their aquarium with the convenience of simple dosing and a blend of bacteria plus enzymes that breakdown excess waste. Pure provides an easy to dose nitrifying bacteria supplement to maintain a well-balanced aquarium. Nitrifying bacteria live on surfaces such as filter media, decor and gravel, converting harmful ammonia and nitrite to less toxic nitrate. By dosing weekly, the enzymes and bacteria breakdown excess waste from over feeding or detritus in the aquarium which can help reduce filter maintenance. The unique sphere design of Pure provides surfaces for the bacteria and enzymes to reside until conditions are idea to be utilized efficiently. This ""time release"" style means Pure cannot be overdosed and any excess bacteria will be waiting until needed. Pure disappears to the eye when added directly to the aquarium and works most effectively when introduced to a filtered tank system. While it does not dissolve completely, the small Pure left behind will go unnoticed and be removed during water changes.</p><ul><li>Easy to dose gel ball</li><li>Cannot be overdosed</li><li>Contains live beneficial bacteria</li><li>Helps maintain clear water</li><li>Safe for all filtered freshwater aquariums</li></ul><p>",Aqueon,NEW,1,9,4.75,1.5,0.7,"ITEMIMAGEURL1=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00137__1.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL2=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00137__2.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL3=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00137__3.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL4=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00137__4.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL5=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00137__5.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL6=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00137__6.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL7=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00137__7.jpg",7,,aqueon-pure-live-beneficial-bacteria-and-enzymes-for-aquariums,https://www.petwholesaleusa.com/products/aqueon-pure-live-beneficial-bacteria-and-enzymes-for-aquariums

It is harvested from pristine ocean waters - not collected from beaches or reefs - and contains no harmful tar, organics, or impurities.</p><p>Its buffering capabilities are unmatched, helping to maintain a proper pH of 8.2 without the constant addition of chemicals to the tank. Each pound of Aragonite provides up to 10,000 square inches of surface area for maximum growth of beneficial, water-purifying bacteria. These bacteria help control nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and other harmful waste products to keep your fish healthy and your tank clean. CaribSea Aragonite Reef Sand has an ideal grain size for reef tanks, fish tanks, plenum systems, Berlin systems, refugiums, and more.</p><p>Directions: Rinse well with clean water. Do not use soap or detergent. 1 to 2 pounds of sand per gallon of water is usually sufficient for most displays. More exact measurements can be obtained from the manufacturers website. For best results, follow all directions on the packaging. When using Aragonite for African cichlids or other freshwater applications, slight cloudiness may persist until the aquarium cycles due to high rates of calcium carbonate dissolution.</p><p>Composition:<br>Magnesium - 1,050 ppm<br>Calcium - 381,000 ppm<br>Strontium - 7,390 ppm<br>Grain Size: 1.0-2.0 mm.</p>",CaribSea,NEW,1,11,17,2,15,"ITEMIMAGEURL1=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/cb00020__1.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL2=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/cb00020__2.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL3=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/cb00020__3.jpg",3,,caribsea-aragonite-special-grade-reef-sand-substrate-perfect-for-marine-reef-and-cichlid-aquaria,https://www.petwholesaleusa.com/products/caribsea-aragonite-special-grade-reef-sand-substrate-perfect-for-marine-reef-and-cichlid-aquaria

Herbivorous and carnivorous diets are frequently calcium deficient and phosphorus rich. Thus, it is of no benefit to use a calcium supplement containing phosphorus. Ideally the dietary calcium to phosphorus (Ca: P) ratio should be no less than 1. 2: 1 and is ideally maintained from 2: 1 up to 8: 1 (depending on the species). Lack of calcium in the diet can lead to metabolic bone disease and shell deformities and soft shells in turtles and tortoises. JurassiCal is also Vitamin D3 free. Although Vitamin D3 is required for calcium processing, it could easily build to toxic levels if it were part of a frequently used calcium supplement.

The plant- and insect-based formula is designed to be tasty, color-enhancing, and meet your fishs daily nutritional needs. And because the food is so digestible, it leads to less waste, better water quality, and more active fish. This helps you create a thriving, healthy ecosystem where your fish feels right at home. And flakes that float near the top of the water are sometimes preferred by fish. Because Nutrinsect is 100% fish-free, choosing this product also helps preserve the earths oceans. Overfishing is a huge issue. Each year, millions of tons of fish are harvested for fishmeal and other commercial uses, which puts a massive strain on the oceans fragile ecosystem. The Nutrinsect formula doesnt use any fish products, helping protect the worlds fish resources.</p><ul><li>Matches what your tropical fish eat in the wild</li><li>Helps preserve the earths oceans</li><li>Meets daily nutritional needs</li><li>Helps your tropical fishs color pop</li><li>Leads to less waste, better water quality, and more active fish</li></ul><p>Most tropical fish dont want to eat other fish in their natural environment. Instead, they prefer eating algae, insects, and small crustaceans. But you might be surprised to learn that most aquarium fish foods tend to include exactly what they dont want: products made with fish, like fishmeal or fish oil. The Nutrinsect 100% fish-free formula provides what your tropical fish truly crave: a plant- and insect-based diet. The tropical fish formula includes ingredients like dried mealworms, dried black soldier fly larvae, algae, freshwater shrimp, dried kelp, and more. As an added bonus, the insects used are all sustainably grown. Some are fed food that would otherwise go to waste, while others are naturally grown in lakes and ponds and require minimal land to be farmed.</p>",Aqueon,NEW,1,2.41,2.41,4.606,0.015,"ITEMIMAGEURL1=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00242__1.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL2=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00242__2.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL3=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00242__3.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL4=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/au00242__4.jpg",4,,aqueon-nutrinsect-tropical-flakes,https://www.petwholesaleusa.com/products/aqueon-nutrinsect-tropical-flakes

As ectotherms, or cold-blooded animals, reptiles depend on the surrounding environmental temperature to regulate their own body temperatures. If the temperature is not appropriate, your pet may be susceptible to digestive problems or infections. Flukers Infrared Deep Thermal Heat Lamp Bulbs feature an advanced carbon fiber filament that emits both Infrared A and Infrared B, providing deep muscle tissue penetration that mimics natural suns heat. The infrared medium wave energy is easily absorbed by the reptile, which gently increases the temperature of their skin. The advanced Infrared Deep Thermal Heat Bulb offers 24/7 heat with minimal visible light and zero UV emission, so it wont disturb the sleep of reptiles or pets. The heating speed is fast and stable, and the heat is balanced and lasting, making it the perfect heat lamp for any style of terrarium. The parabolic reflector focuses heatwaves for optimal basking conditions, making it the perfect solution to maintain the humidity in your enclosure and prevent dehydration, as they do not evaporate water as quickly as standard heating lamps. These bulbs are manufactured with precision, resulting in higher quality and long-lasting durability. The carbon fiber filament ensures constant heat emission, while the heavy-duty construction guarantees higher durability and longevity. To ensure proper use, refer to the convenient temperature guide on the packaging.

The medication can also treat fungal infections in fishes.</p><p>Rid Ich+ is recommended as the best chemical treatment for Ich, (white spot disease), having been originally developed decades ago for professional aquaculture, public aquariums, and government use in treating fishes. Other than refinement in ingredients, it has continued to remain as the foremost scientifically developed chemical treatment for Ich white spot disease. Efficacy is improved and the treatment time is often reduced when compared to treatment with either the chemicals malachite or formalin alone. Additionally, the Rid Ich+ formula utilizes the less common but also less toxic chloride salt of malachite green (this is the same salt used in Kordons Malachite Green).</p><p>The recommended treatment concentration of Rid Ich+ should be approached with caution, carefully observing the reactions of the treated fishes and ceasing treatment if any undue stress is noted. Remember, when the first outward signs of Ich (scattered spots) are noticed, the fish is often quite heavily parasitic in the mouth and gills - lowering the fishs ability to withstand additional stress. The weaker the fishes condition, the poorer its response will be to any medication.

It also raises carbonate alkalinity without immediately impacting water pH, and will stabilize aquarium water at pH 8.3 with long term use.</p><ul><li>Raises carbonate alkalinity (KH) with minimal pH impact</li><li>Provides a blend of carbonate sources that will not lower pH</li><li>Will not deplete calcium, magnesium, or strontium</li><li>Promotes healthy coral growth</li></ul><p>If either calcium or carbonates become deficient, coral growth will cease, followed by a rapid decline in coral health. Used as directed, Seachem Reef Builder will not deplete calcium, magnesium, or strontium which usually tend to precipitate with increasing alkalinity.</p><p>Seachem Reef Builder and Reef Buffer may be used together: use Reef Builder to raise carbonate alkalinity without affecting pH, and use Reef Buffer to raise carbonate alkalinity and pH. As a general rule, reef alkalinity should be maintained at 3&ndash;5 meq/L (8&ndash;14 dKH); alkalinity should not be allowed to fall below 2 meq/L.</p><p>Directions:<br>BEGINNER: Use 3 g (1/2 level teaspoon) per 150 L (40 gallons) twice a week. Dissolve in at least 250 ml (1 cup) of freshwater. Check alkalinity every 2 weeks and adjust amount or frequency accordingly. For precise dosing, use the Seachem Digital Spoon Scale.</p><p>ADVANCED: Check alkalinity, then follow addition regimen above until alkalinity is adjusted to 4&ndash;5 meq/L. Each 3 g/150 L will raise alkalinity by about 0.25 meq/L. Quantity or frequency can be adjusted, but do not exceed 12 g/150 L per day. Thereafter, use as required to maintain alkalinity.</p><p>EXPERT: After determining the alkalinity consumption rate, set up a continuous drip system. Use the following formula to determine how much to add to your top&ndash;off water: m=0.08va (m=grams to add to top off water, v=volume of tank in liters, a=amount to raise alkalinity in meq/L). For example, if you want to raise your alkalinity by 1 meq/L in a 200 liter tank, then you would add 0.08x200x1=16 g into the top&ndash;off water. [For reference: 1 gallon=3.8 liters, 6 g=1 teaspoon].</p><p>DO NOT OVERDOSE: Excess alkalinity may enhance the loss of calcium, magnesium, and strontium. Do not directly mix with any calcium, magnesium, or strontium supplement. Best if calcium and carbonate additives are added on alternate days or at least 30 minutes apart.</p>",Seachem,NEW,1,2.44,2.44,4.81,0.86,"ITEMIMAGEURL1=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/sc03660__1.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL2=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/sc03660__2.jpg",2,,seachem-reef-builder-raises-carbonate-alkalinity,https://www.petwholesaleusa.com/products/seachem-reef-builder-raises-carbonate-alkalinity

For the puplounge, make sure to remove the bolster cushion from the cover, as well, as the bolster is not machine washable. Wash the cover in cold water on the gentle cycle and hang to dry. A damp cloth can also be used to remove stains from the cover.Cleaning the Memory FoamThe memory foam is not machine washable, but there are several ways to clean it. To freshen it up, lightly sprinkle baking powder on the foam. This will give the foam a fresh smell. Let it sit for 30 minutes. Then vacuum the baking powder with a vacuum cleaner, which can also remove pet hair from the memory foam. To remove a stain, use a damp cloth with warm water and a small amount of dishwashing soap to rub the stain in a light circular motion. Let it sit for 10 minutes and press out as much moisture as you can without ""wringing out"" the foam, because wet foam can tear more easily. To dry the memory foam, leave it to air dry.Cleaning the Memory Foam Base LinerTo clean the liner, use a damp cloth with warm water to remove stains.<p>",Paw,NEW,1,38.98,13.39,10.24,16.1,"ITEMIMAGEURL1=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/paw91083__1.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL2=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/paw91083__2.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL3=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/paw91083__3.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL4=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/paw91083__4.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL5=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/paw91083__5.jpg,ITEMIMAGEURL6=https://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/12048233/images/paw91083__6.jpg",6,,paw-puplounge-memory-foam-bolster-bed-topper,https://www.petwholesaleusa.com/products/paw-puplounge-memory-foam-bolster-bed-topper
